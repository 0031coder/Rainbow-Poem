RED
The blood of angry men
ORANGE
The fires burning on the barricade
YELLOW
The jaundiced sky of a grim day
GREEN
Looks like trenchfoot.  Poor bastards...
BLUE
How I feel, looking at these empty chairs and empty tables, now my friends are dead and gone...
INDIGO
Like Blue, but for the FAT CATS AND THE BOURGOISE!
VIOLET
Violet Beuregard is exactly the kind of person who'll be up against the wall when the revolution comes.
