The Rainbow and the Unicorn and the Pony

Today is Earth Day.
I love Earth Day.
Purple rain
is not pink
is not orange either
Blue is cold
Teal
Green
Indigo
Recycle!
Unicorn
Yellow
Red is hot
These are the colors of the rainbow.
And the unicorn.
Pony:
Peter Pony drinks a cup of oolong tea.
It tastes wonderful.
There must have been some cicadas on those leaves, how lucky!
