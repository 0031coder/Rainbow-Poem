It's spring now here in Jiangnan University Wuxi.
The weather is pretty facinating
And just now i have watched shiffman's videos on how to use github on bilibili.com
I think his vedios are pretty good
And now i basically understand how to use it.
Anyway,Thanks for his videos
Coding continuing...
国外的小伙伴，你们吼呀
所以我不会是第一个在这留言的Chinese吧


Spring is good.
And i love coding.
