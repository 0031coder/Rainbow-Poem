No rainbows in the sky
No clouds trying to fly
No water around unless you cry
The heat over here will make you sigh

But lets forget all about that
I mean you can take care of the heat with a small hat
Lets create a program that will calculate your long and lat
And when taking breaks, play with the cat

Because we really enjoy riding the coding train
We like it more than a candy cane
Let's create some purple rain
or a simulation of a powerful crane

And when we're done we are super excited
Because we all love when the coding train's engine is ignited

I am an indian by heart
And coder by soul!

Thank you CODING TRAIN!
from all of your indian fans!!!
