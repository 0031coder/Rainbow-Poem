No rainbows in the sky
No clouds and rains
No water till sun shine
I want to forget about all that
and i really enjoy riding on coding train
Because it is the coding train time.
Because when the train starts I cant stop
and when my dreams come true, I am gonna dance on hip hop like Mithun Da!
and do epic stuff!
I am an indian by heart
I enjoy the ride of coding train :)
And coder by soul!
I love not only git but also github,
Lets go to the pub!
:)
test
Yohooo!!

i love coding

This is a very good poem and I want to admire it.

Hmm what are you expecting more about it Just close the document. 

Ok then lets mess things much more than you actually think and lets see waht happens for that .
For a good start on git and guthub 
it takes some pain,
nevertheless, just hop into the coding train.

India is my country
It is really a beautiful place 

i learn something about gihub
